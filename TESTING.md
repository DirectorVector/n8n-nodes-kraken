# 🚀 Testing the Kraken n8n Node

Your Kraken n8n node has been successfully built and is ready for testing! Here's how to test it:

## ✅ Build Status
- ✅ **Build Successful**: The TypeScript compilation completed without errors
- ✅ **API Integration**: All Kraken API methods are properly integrated
- ✅ **Public Endpoints Tested**: Market data endpoints are working correctly

## 🧪 Test Results

The following public API endpoints have been tested and are working:

1. **Asset Info** (`assets()`) - ✅ Working
2. **Asset Pairs** (`assetPairs()`) - ✅ Working  
3. **Ticker Data** (`ticker()`) - ✅ Working (BTC/USD: $118,237.30)
4. **OHLC Data** (`ohlc()`) - ✅ Working (720 data points returned)

## 🎯 How to Test in n8n

### Option 1: Install in Local n8n Instance

1. **Build the node** (already done):
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Install in your n8n instance**:
   ```bash
   # Navigate to your n8n user directory
   cd ~/.n8n/nodes
   
   # Create the kraken directory if it doesn't exist
   mkdir -p n8n-nodes-kraken
   
   # Copy the built files
   cp -r /path/to/this/project/dist/* n8n-nodes-kraken/
   ```

3. **Restart n8n** to load the new node

4. **Create credentials**:
   - Go to Settings → Credentials
   - Add new credential of type "Kraken API"
   - For testing public endpoints, you can use dummy values
   - For private endpoints, use your actual Kraken API key and secret

### Option 2: Test with Node.js Script

Run the included test script to verify API functionality:

```bash
node test-node.js
```

### Option 3: Use Demo Workflow

A demo workflow file (`demo-workflow.json`) is included that demonstrates:
- Getting BTC/USD ticker price
- Fetching asset information
- Retrieving asset pairs
